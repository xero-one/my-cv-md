            Kellis Investments Group needed a professional website to increase its
            presence and needed a digital solution to facilitate conversion of sales. They
            also needed a way to organize customer inquiries and ways to collect emails. I
            solved this problem by implementing a secure, long, single page web application
            with, a large hero, carousel portfolio, and content in a funnel like fashion to
            attract website visitors. Added a Facebook messenger app to the website to connect
            the owner’s Facebook business page in order to direct messages with Facebook’s
            API.  Like Dream Lens, I also added a contact form to further increase
            conversion efforts by directing all customers inquires to the owner’s business
            email upon inquirers’ submission.

            Dream Lens, my first fully serviced client that I completed a large body of work for. Part of that large body of work include the need for a website to upstart the owner’s small media production business. I decided to professionally test my Full stack development skills on this client’s project by going above and beyond. I created a custom wireframe and successfully implemented it in front-end code. I designed all svg graphics and implemented them in the front-end code base. I successfully implemented heavy animations that increases presentability and user experience without effecting the user’s browser performance. Included a smart form, “strict-forms” that watch for profanity and validates data on the front-end before it reaches the back-end. I designed a REST api to post (send) inquirer data upon form submission to the back-end where I also created a SMTP server to intake data and send the data with a valid gmail account. The data sent in the emails are custom coded email-templates. The application’s back-end is serverless and hosted to Firebase and uses its recently introduced cloud functions. Dream Lens is regularly maintained on a daily basis by me.

        <p>
            A group of developers and I came up with a project to replace the dying Yelp
            web application. Hence Eats++, a revolutionary web application similar to Yelp,
            where restaurant patrons can share their experiences through rating and social
            interaction over the web application with other website visitors. Eat++ is more
            social based and intended to engage audiences from various demographics where
            information about the same niche can be easily exchanged. In this project I
            managed the creative aspects and brainstorm sessions of the project. I
            implemented the entire front-end of the website from a wire frame I designed
            before production of the web application. In its production phase I designed all
            the graphics in svg and implemented them into the HTML code base. I used
            Materialized CDN to create responsive CSS and more. Fun fact, the awesome name
            was originated by me, which came from the thought of being more than just
            dining out and being more socially trendy “Eats Plus Plus”.

            Studying BASH on my spare time I realized the potential of this great programming language. In my extensive history of dealing with computers, I realized so many issues I had with file management. BASH is the perfect solution to passively manage your Macs file base.  I decided to make a BASH script to manage duplicate files, erase day old executable files (DMG & ZIP), and erase day old documents (PDF, PNG, and JPEG) files from the users downloads directory to prevent clutter. This BASH script is for developers and non-developers (with minimal BASH experience).

            I decided to test my programing knowledge daily, aside from building real world applications in order to focus on the core of functional programming. In this repo you can find mainly, JavaScript and Python solutions to similar software problems, all solved individually by me. The goal of this repo is to challenge my program solving skills in my favorite programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, BASH, and SQL), and prove that with strong pseudocode, you can solve similar problems in any language. Out of all projects this personal on-going project will always keep me up to date on current programming concepts and features.
